This is a web scraping project that focuses on collecting and analyzing data from [Diy.com][https://www.diy.com/]. The goal of the project is to extract customer reviews, date, ratings, and product information from the website for further analysis and insights. The project utilizes the Scrapy framework to automate the process of data collection and processing.

## Project Overview

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. In this project, we aim to gather data for tools brands to gain valuable insights for our analysis. The collected data include ratings, dates, reviews, and other relevant information.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Collect data for mainstream tools brands efficiently and accurately.
- Process and clean the collected data for analysis.
- Store the collected data in SQL databased for management.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are employed in this project:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for web scraping and data processing.
- **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- **Requests**: A Python library for making HTTP requests to retrieve web content.
- **Scrapy**: A powerful web crawling and scraping framework for Python.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for coding and data analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: We use web scraping techniques to fetch data from target websites. This involves sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and extracting relevant data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The collected data is often messy and requires cleaning. This step involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
3. **Data Analysis**: With the cleaned data, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and gain insights using various statistical and visual methods.
4. **Data Visualization**: The insights obtained are presented through graphs, charts, and visualizations to make them more understandable and insightful.
